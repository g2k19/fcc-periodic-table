# fcc-periodic-table
This is just the repository needed for completing the fcc project. It contains the database file with the data for the elements as well as the script file to get information about the elements.

More information about the actual project can be found on [freeCodeCamp's website](https://www.freecodecamp.org) under the Relational Database section of the Cirriculum.
